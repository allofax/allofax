### Hello! 👋

Thanks for checking out my profile! Here's a few things about me:

- 🖥 I'm an Associate Software Engineer at OpenBet 
- 🔮 I'd like to focus more on other backend technologies
- ☕️ Java is great IMO, I'll kiss whoever designed the JVM

I'll be changing what I do over time and posting it here, so watch this space!
